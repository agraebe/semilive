# SemiLive Atom Plugin
Got inspired by @toji from his talk at Google I/O. He created an automated way for semi-live coding sessions on stage. Unfortunately, he uses Sublime Text. So, here we go my fellow Atom users!

# Todos
- [ ] replace with char-by-char
- [ ] sub-script execution
- [ ] dynamic menu items for process details
- [ ] easier way to maintain (create and load) scripts
- [ ] clean-up
