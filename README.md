# SemiLive Atom Plugin
Got inspired by @toji from his talk at Google I/O. He created an automated way for semi-live coding sessions on stage. Unfortunately, he uses Sublime Text. So, here we go my fellow Atom users!

# Todos
- [ ] implement easier way to maintain (create and load) scripts
- [ ] create and update specs
- [ ] clean-up for efficiency

# Credits
Inspired by [toji's sublime plugin for live coding](https://github.com/toji/semilive)
